## GitHub Statistics
- Stars: The number of stars a GitHub repository has received indicates its popularity and the level of community support. More stars often correlate with a more reputable and well-maintained project.

- Forks: The number of times a repository has been forked shows the level of collaborative interest in the project. A higher number of forks usually indicates an active developer community.

- Open Issues: The number of unresolved issues can serve as an indicator of the project's responsiveness to community feedback and potential bugs. Fewer open issues generally suggest a more stable project.

- Watchers: The number of users following a repository for updates reflects the level of ongoing interest and engagement with the project.

- Repository Size: The size of the codebase can indicate the complexity and maturity of the project. Larger repositories often contain more features but may also require more maintenance.
- Network Count: This represents the number of repositories that are forks of the original repository, providing another angle on the project's influence and reach within the developer community.

- Subscribers: The number of users subscribed to receive notifications for updates can indicate the level of active engagement and interest in the project's future developments.
